# AngularFirstApp
My First App using Angular, It is an House Gallery, It was based on a tutorial about Angular, had to make some adaptations to use an newer version of Angular when I did it.
To run it make sure you have port 3000 and 4200 free, because it uses 3000 for the db.json file with houses plus the 4200 port to run the main web application.
In case any image is not working, get an new URL with a new photo, the originalpage may be inacessible or changed it's way.
