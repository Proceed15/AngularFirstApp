# AngularFirstApp
My First App using Angular, it is an House Gallery based on a tutorial about from Angular Official Website, had to make some adaptations to use an newer version of Angular when I did it.
To run it make sure you have port 3000 and 4200 free, because it uses 3000 for the db.json file with house examples plus the 4200 port to run the main web application, if you want to use another ports change the configuration and access files to these ports.
In case any image is not working, get an new URL with a new photo, the original page may be inacessible or changed it's way.
